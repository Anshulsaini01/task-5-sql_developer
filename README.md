# 🧩 SQL Joins Tutorial: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL

## 📘 Objective
Master the art of combining data across multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations. This exercise walks through all four major types of joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`, helping you build a strong foundation in database querying.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **DB Browser for SQLite**
- **MySQL Workbench**

## 📦 Task Overview
Create two related tables — for example:
- `Customers`: Basic customer information
- `Orders`: Records of customer purchases

Then use SQL joins to answer questions like:
- Which customers placed orders?
- Who didn’t place any orders?
- Which orders don't match a customer?

## 🔗 JOIN Types Covered

| JOIN Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `INNER JOIN` | Returns records with matching values in both tables |
| `LEFT JOIN` | Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | Returns all records when there is a match in either table |

> Note: `FULL JOIN` may not be supported in SQLite directly — workaround provided.

## 📂 Deliverables
This repository contains:
- ✅ SQL queries demonstrating each type of JOIN
- ✅ Database setup scripts for `Customers` and `Orders`
- ✅ Sample data for testing
- ✅ Comments and notes explaining JOIN results

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
By completing this task, you'll be able to:
- Understand and apply each JOIN type confidently
- Merge and analyze data across multiple tables
- Optimize queries for real-world applications

## 🚀 Get Started
Clone the repo, open it in your preferred SQL tool, and run the scripts step-by-step. Each query builds understanding progressively.
